The new_handle function returns a Handle object with a url and a
           node id. The new_handle function invokes the localize_handle
           method first to set the url and then invokes the initialize_handle
           function to get an ID.

=item Description

The localize_handle function attempts to locate a shock server near
            the service. The localize_handle function must be called before the
           Handle is initialized becuase when the handle is initialized, it is
           given a node id that maps to the shock server where the node was
           created. This function should not be called directly.

=item Description

Handle provides a unique reference that enables
           access to the data files through functions
           provided as part of the HandleService. In the case of using
           shock, the id is the node id. In the case of using
           shock the value of type is shock. In the future 
           these values should enumerated. The value of url is
           the http address of the shock server, including the
           protocol (http or https) and if necessary the port.
           The values of remote_md5 and remote_sha1 are those
           computed on the file in the remote data store. These
           can be used to verify uploads and downloads.
